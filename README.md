# YetAnotherBackgroundTheme
Yet Another Background Theme Project for Aliucord
![NA](https://github.com/RhyMegu/YetAnotherBackgroundTheme/blob/main/Resources/Title.png?raw=true)

## Description
This project was started because of my sheer hatred towards transparent themes. They clog the themes feed, making actually good themes not visible and are generally low effort all around. So why not concentrate all those bad themes in one place?
This project aims to provide a template for transparent themes which is simple enough for anyone to edit and use, and provide a platform for them to share their themes.

## How to install themes?
