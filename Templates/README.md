# Template Modification 
Currently, there is no streamlined process to edit the templates to customize them. Instead, you will need to manually download the JSON file and replace certain values with the colors you desire.

## Design Advice 
You can choose to follow this advice, but it is not compulsory. It's simply some tips to make your theme appear more coherent and stylistic.

| Color Value | Advice |
| :---: | :---: |
| accent | Choose the dominant color of the background. |
| offdark | Choose the secondary color of the background which contrasts well enough with the accent. |
| highlight | Choose the complimentary color of the accent. |
| switch | offdark but darker |
| white | Keep the color as close to white as possibble, but you can add a bit of a tint to make the colors pop out. |
| channel | A lighter color of offdark which is still visibly darker than white. |
| offlight | A lighter color of accent. |
